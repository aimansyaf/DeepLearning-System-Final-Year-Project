# DeepLearning-System-Final-Year-Project

# Title Project
- Real-Time Intelligent Recycle Waste Detection and Classification Using You Only Look Once Version 5. This is my final year project for 2023. I used Visual Studio code to develop the back-end Python and streamlit framework, and I used Jupyter Notebook and Google Collaboration to create the detection model.
  
# introduction
- Real-Time Intelligent Recycle Waste Detection and Classification Using You Only Look Once Version 5
  model is capable to detect the recycle waste according to its type such as plastic, metal and paper.
  This system also can monitor the capacity of waste and get notification through email using Blynk
  cloud which platform of Internet of Things (IoT). 

## Run the app
* Terminal
    
    streamlit run app.py
  
* VSCode
  * Open the repo directory in VSCode
  * Open app.py
  * Start debugging with F5
  * Stop debugging with Shift-F5

#Step to use 
- This page contain 5 pages which is Homepage, Instruction, Upload Image YOLO,
Real-Time Yolo and Monitoring and notification.
This page contain 5 pages which is Homepage, Instruction, Upload Image YOLO,
Real-Time Yolo and Monitoring and notification.

- Click upload image yolo page and choose whether you want to detect such as
as paper, plastic or metal. After that you will get result the type of recycle waste and its accuracy.

- Click real time yolo page and you will redirect to real time camera. 
you must put your object want to detect such as metal, paper or plastic near the camera.
After that you will get result the type of recycle waste and its accuracy.

- If user want to monitor and get notification you can login by using blynk acccount 
with their valid registration.After that you can monitor the capacity of waste

#Conclusion
- The implementation of the real-time intelligent recycle waste detection and classification using yolov5 algorithm has proven to be highly successful. The mAP50 is 91.9% and the system efficiently detects and classifies plastic, paper and metal in uploaded images and real-time video streams with a high accuracy rate. As a result, all the objectves have been acheived.
